# EEG_DeepLearning_Classification
A study investigating the evaluation of different deep learning architectures for analysing brain activity time series data in the context of visual perception, focusing on classifying 10 brightness levels, ranging from 0.1 to 1, recorded across 31 spatial channels (electrodes), from 5 participants exposed to 2 distinct visual stimuli.
